Since Bricks 1.3.7 you'll be able to decide if a certain element query should be merged with the WordPress main query, in the archive or search templates, using the following filter:

```php
add_filter( 'bricks/posts/merge_query', function( $merge, $element_id ) {
  if ( $element_id === 'wghgco' ) {
    return false;
  }

  return $merge;
}, 10, 2 );
```

The filter callback receives two arguments:

- `$merge` is a boolean variable indicating whether the query should be merged or not (default: true)
- `$element_id` is a string containing the element ID

This is triggered for all the Bricks elements containing one internal WP_Query query like the Posts and the Carousel element, or any other element where the Query Loop is enabled (Container, Slider, Accordion).



:::note
Starting from Bricks 1.7, you can achieve the same result by utilizing the "Disable Query Merge" option in the [Query Loop](/builder/dynamic-content/query-loop/#posts-query), without the need for a PHP filter. Use this filter for more advanced situations.

## How to find the element ID? {#find-element-id}

Each element in Bricks has a unique ID. You may find the element ID when editing the element and looking into the Global CSS classes input. By default, it shows the element HTML ID (e.g. `#bricks-element-wghgco`). For the purpose of this filter, we only need the last portion of the string, the six-character long element ID (e.g. `wghgco`).
