Filters the count data specifically for WooCommerce field filters (e.g., price, rating). This allows you to customize the counts displayed next to filter options.

## Parameters

- `$count_source` (*array*): Associative array where keys are filter values and values are their respective counts.
- `$element` (*object*): The filter element instance.

## Example usage

```php
add_filter( 'bricks/filter_element/count_source_wcField', function( $count_source, $element ) {
    // Example: Hide counts for rating filter by setting them to 0 (if logic hides 0 counts)
    // Or manipulate them for specific ratings
    return $count_source;
}, 10, 2 );
```
