The **Slot** element is used **inside Bricks components** as a **placeholder**: when you place a component instance on the canvas, the content you add into that instance is rendered in place of each Slot.

On the front end, the Slot outputs **nothing by itself**—it only renders the child elements assigned to that slot on the **component instance** (`slotChildren` for that Slot id). If there is no matching instance or no children, the Slot outputs nothing.

The element shows a single **info** control explaining that it acts as a placeholder for instance content.

:::tip[Nestable]
Slot uses the nestable builder UI (`bricks-nestable`) but does not ship with default nested children; structure is defined in your **component** template.
