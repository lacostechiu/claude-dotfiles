Use dynamic data to render all sorts of data from your WordPress database with Bricks.

For example: Featured image, post title, post date, author name, categories, tags, site title, all of your custom fields, etc.

You'll most likely use dynamic data when creating templates in Bricks. Such as your blog post template, and custom post type templates (e.g. single property listing).

## How to insert dynamic data

The dynamic data picker for text shows up when typing a "\{" onto the canvas. You can also click the "bolt" icon in the settings panel to reveal it:

https://youtu.be/w4Bv-Pd6n2w

Dynamic data for non-text settings such as images, videos, etc. is available from the "Select dynamic data" dropdown menu in the panel settings.

Below you can see an Advanced Custom Fields gallery (named "Gallery") rendered inside the Bricks image gallery element:

![](imgs/builder-dynamic-data-panel-1024x576-66a7446700.png)

All dynamic data tags are available in all elements that support dynamic data. This means that you may insert a gallery field (like an ACF gallery field type) inside a text element and it will be rendered as a set of `img` tags (using the filter `:image`), like so:

![](imgs/dynamic-data-gallery-text-element-8b39206318.png)

![](imgs/dynamic-data-gallery-output-text-element-53d9e58f02.png)



## Custom Fields Integrations {#integrations}

You can render much more than just standard dynamic WordPress data. Bricks supports the most popular custom fields plugins such as:

- [Advanced Custom Fields](#acf)
- [Meta box](#metabox)
- [Crocoblock (JetEngine)](#jetengine) (Not support WooCommerce Product Data / Variation Meta Box)
- Pods
- CMB2
- Toolset

This allows you to design templates for even the most complex custom post type layouts and data requirements.

### Advanced Custom Fields {#acf}

Bricks integrates with all the ACF and ACF Pro fields, including Flexible Content and Nested Groups.

The fields will be listed in the Dynamic Data dropdown inside of the Bricks builder so you can use them while building your pages and templates with Bricks.

The Relationship (including the [bidirectional](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/bidirectional-relationships/) implementation) and the Repeater field types are also available inside the Query Loop builder, so you could loop through the output of these fields while rendering the sub-fields as dynamic data.

The ACF field type "[True / False](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/true-false/)" is great for conditional checks inside the element conditions. By default, the localized "True / False" label is returned. When using it in your element conditions, make sure to apply the `:value` filter. To check for false, you can compare against `== 0`. Or `== 1` to check for true.



![](imgs/bricks-acf-field-type-true-false-e6d665226f.png)

Check if ACF True / False field is false

</figcaption>



The following dynamic data can be used together with [Element conditions](/builder/features/element-conditions/) effectively.

`{acf_get_row_layout:raw}` - Returns the ACF Flexible layout name

### Meta Box {#metabox}

Bricks is compatible with the Meta Box Post Types, Taxonomies, Custom Fields, and Relationships. Regarding the Custom Fields, Bricks will list the fields inside the builder in the Dynamic Data dropdown. According to the custom field contents, these tags will be rendered properly in the front end.

The Group field (when cloneable) and the Relationships will also be available inside the Query Loop builder. You can iterate through these values and render the sub-fields as dynamic data.

It is also possible to build nested non-clone-able Group fields in Bricks Query Loop.

### Crocoblock JetEngine {#jetengine}

Bricks is compatible with Crocoblock JetEngine Post Types, Meta Boxes (Custom fields), Taxonomies, Relations, and Options pages.

[Custom Content Types](https://crocoblock.com/knowledge-base/jetengine/how-to-showcase-cct-meta-fields-using-dynamic-tags-in-bricks/) (CCT) has been supported since April 2024 by the JetEngine plugin, not Bricks itself. For any CCT questions, please get in touch with the JetEngine support directly.

Bricks integration with the JetEngine plugin makes the custom fields available as dynamic data inside the Bricks builder.

Bricks also integrates with the JetEngine Relations and Repeaters to feed the Bricks builder query loop.

## Standard WordPress data {#wordpress}

By default, you may use the following dynamic data tags.

### Post fields {#post-fields}

The following fields are related to the posts or custom post types.

### Taxonomies {#taxonomies}

The following dynamic data tags render a list of the taxonomy terms assigned to a post. A link to the term archive wraps each term:

`{post_terms_category}`

`{post_terms_post_tag}`

`{post_terms_my_taxonomy_slug}` - Replace the "my_taxonomy_slug" part with the slug of the actual taxonomy you want to use

`{post_terms_category:plain}` - Remove the links via :plain filter



If you already use a link around your element, you can disable the terms' links output using the [`bricks/dynamic_data/post_terms_links`](/developer/hooks/filters/filter-bricks-dynamic_data-post_terms_links/) filter.

### Terms {#terms}

The following dynamic data tags render data related to taxonomy terms.

`{term_id}` - Renders the term ID

See [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/get_the_author_meta/#description) for available author meta keys.



These fields support dynamic data filters like the following:

`{author_bio:20}` - Post author biographical info limited to 20 words

`{author_name:link}` - Post author name rendered as a link to the author profile page

`{author_email:link}` - Post author email rendered as a link

`{author_website:link}` - Post author website rendered as a link

`{author_avatar:200}` - Post author avatar image tag limited to the width/height of 200px



### Query fields {#query}

`{query_loop_index:raw}` - Returns the index of the current loop item, starting at 0. Use the `@start-at` argument to start the index from any other number. Example: `{query_loop_index:raw @start-at:1}` to start the index at 1 instead of 0. The `@pad` argument lets you define a 0-based padding. Using `{query_loop_index @pad:2:raw}` results in an index output of `001` and `010` instead of `1` and `10`.

`{query_results_count:raw}` – Use inside or outside a query loop to return the query results count. When used outside a loop you have to pass the query loop ID as a filter to this tag like this: `{query_results_count:quer34:raw}`. "quer34" in this example is the Bricks ID, which you can copy to your clipboard from the right-click context menu.

### Site & Archive fields {#site-archive}

### Native WordPress custom fields

To render your own custom field entries, you have to prefix them with `cf_`.

If your custom field name is `phone_number`, you'd use `{cf_phone_number}` to render this custom field on the front end.

Your `phone_number` custom field entry should also be available in the dynamic data picker dropdown under "Custom fields".

## Date Dynamic Tags {#date}

### Current Date fields {#current-date}

You can render the current date through dynamic data.

`{current_date}` - Returns the current date (UTC) with the format defined at WordPress > Settings > General > Date Format

`{current_wp_date}` - Returns the current date (WordPress timezone) with the format defined at WordPress > Settings > General > Date Format

You may specify a different date format using the PHP date format, for example:

`{current_date:Y}`

`{current_date:Ymd}`

`{current_date:Y-m-d}`

`{current_date:Y.m.d}`

`{current_date:Y/m/d}`

`{current_date:Y m d}`

`{current_date:g:i A}`

`{current_date:timestamp}`



### Format Date {#format-date}

Bricks 2.2 introduces a new dynamic tag `{format_date:raw}` that allows you to convert a date string from one format to another — directly within the builder, without writing any PHP.

`{format_date:raw @date:'your-date-value' @from:'input-format' @to:'output-format'}`

Parameters

- `@date`: The original date string to convert. This can be a raw date or another dynamic tag
- `@from`: The input format (e.g., `Y-m-d`, `Y/m/d`, `Y-m-d\TH:i:s.v\Z`, etc. [https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php) )
- `@to`: The desired output format (e.g., `d M Y`, `timestamp`, `Y-m-d (l)`)

##### Example 1: Simple Date format conversion

`{format_date:raw @date:'2025-01-10' @from:'Y-m-d' @to:'d M Y'}`

**Output:** `10 Jan 2025`

##### Example 2: Format from API Response

Assume this dynamic tag returns an ISO-formatted datetime string:

`{query_api:raw @key:'registered'}` → 2025-04-30T09:41:02.053Z

`{format_date:raw @date:'{query_api:raw @key:'registered'}' @from:'Y-m-d\TH:i:s.v\Z' @to:'Y m d (l)'}`

**Output:** `2025 04 30 (Wednesday)`

---

`{query_api:raw @key:'publishDate'}` → 2025-09-22T11:22:33.0123456Z

`{format_date:raw @date:'{query_api:raw @key:'publishDate'}' @from:'Y-m-d\TH:i:s.u\Z' @to:'Y-m-d H:i'}`

**Output:** `2025-09-22 11:22`

##### Example 3: Convert to Timestamp

This is useful especially when you want to use in condition to compare 2 different dates.

Assume a custom field (by your custom plugin) dynamic tag returns a date:

`{cf_my_date:raw}` → 2025/03/25

You can convert it to a UNIX timestamp for comparison:

`{format_date:raw @date:'{cf_my_date:raw}' @from:'Y/m/d' @to:'timestamp'}`

**Output:** `174277440`

### Advanced: echo {#advanced}

:::note
Starting at Bricks 1.9.7, you have to explicitly allow any function names that you want to call via Bricks’ dynamic data `echo` tag using the new `bricks/code/echo_function_names` filter. Which you can add to your Bricks child theme or the code snippet plugin of your choice. You can find more information in this article: [/developer/hooks/filters/filter-bricks-code-echo_function_names/](/developer/hooks/filters/filter-bricks-code-echo_function_names/)
:::

Bricks 1.4 introduces the `echo` tag to render the output of any PHP function:

`{echo:my_custom_function}` - Echoes the value of the PHP function `my_custom_function()`



It accepts arguments, with or without single quotes, like so:

`{echo:get_the_date('Y-m-d', '55')}` - Echoes the date of the post 55 formatted to `Y-m-d`



### Argument Formatting Rule

When passing arguments to functions inside `{echo::raw}` tags, all arguments must be enclosed in single quotes, regardless of whether they are static values or dynamic tags. (`@since 1.9.3`)

`{echo:my_function('static value')}`

`{echo:my_function('{post_title}')}`

:::note
Please note that the `echo` tag does not support double quotes, and the custom PHP function should `return` the value (do not `echo` the value inside of the custom function).
:::

### Advanced: do_action {#do_action}

The `do_action` tag enables developers and other plugins to integrate with your template designs seamlessly. With this tag, you can place action hooks such as `{do_action:my_custom_hook}` anywhere.

For example, you can insert the `{do_action:woocommerce_after_single_product}` in your WooCommerce single product template, allowing other plugins to hook into it. This enhances the flexibility of your template design.

:::note
It is important to note that the `do_action` tag does not support passing arguments to the action. If the `add_action()` function expects additional arguments, an error in PHP will occur. The `do_action` only runs on the front end of the website, not inside the builder.
:::

### WooCommerce {#user-profile}

When the WooCommerce plugin is installed and active, you'll get access to an extra set of Dynamic Data tags related to the products and orders. Please refer to the [WooCommerce builder](/integrations/woocommerce/woocommerce-builder/#dynamic-data) article for more details.

## Filters {#filters}

You can change the output of certain dynamic data tags by using the following filters:

- `:*numeric value*` - When used on a text field, it trims the content to the number of words specified (e.g. `{post_excerpt:10}`). When used with an avatar field like `author_avatar` it specifies the width/height of the avatar image
- `:context` *or* `:prefix` - Add context to the archive title
- `:image `- Outputs the field as an image tag, *e.g.* ``
- `:link` - Output the field as an anchor tag, *e.g.* [`*value*`](https://...)
- `:newTab` - Sets the link to open in a new tab
- `:tel` - The URL of the anchor will be formatted as a telephone number,
*e.g.* [`+123456789`](tel:+123456789)
- `:*text value *`- Depending on the context, it could mean the following:
  - User or term custom field meta key
  - The URL parameter key
  - Post terms separator
  - Date format
  - Image size slug (e.g., thumbnail or full)
  - The echo tag function name
- `:value` - Outputs the value instead of the label. Useful for comparing choices field types like MetaBox checkbox list, etc. inside element conditions, or with ACF choice fields (set the return type to "Both (Array)") such as Select, Checkbox, Radio Button, and Button Group. ACF field types that supporting this filter: True/False, User, Taxonomy, Image, Gallery, Post Object, Relationship (`@since 1.12`) MetaBox field types that supporting this filter: File Input, File, File Upload, File Advanced, Video, Image, Image Advanced, Image Upload, Single Image, Image Select Taxonomy, Taxonomy Advanced, Post, User (`@since 1.12`)
- `:raw` - Skip parsing dynamic data tag
- `:url` - Return URL from post ID. Useful to return URL for `file` field, etc.
- `:format` - Keep HTML format or show empty Star rating for [WooCommerce dynamic data](/integrations/woocommerce/woocommerce-builder/#dynamic-data)
- `:plain` - Removes HTML tags using `wp_strip_all_tags`, which can be helpful when you need to extract plain text from a dynamic tag result. For example, you may want to remove links from a post term dynamic tag.
- `:array_value|{KEY}` - Returns the value of a specific array key within a dynamic tag result. It can be particularly useful for custom fields such as ACF Google Map and ACF Link types. The filter can also be applied to an echo dynamic tag. In cases where the value is a nested array, Bricks will flatten it as a JSON string to allow for seamless output without any errors. It's important to note that this filter should only be used when you are certain that the dynamic tag result is an array. Another important point to keep in mind is that if the specified array key does not exist, this filter will return an empty string. [Examples](#array_value-filter-examples)
- `:timestamp` - Convert the date or time related dynamic data to timestamp value.
- `:slug` and `:term_id` - Used in `{post_terms_xxxx}` dynamic tags, to output slug or term ID, instead of the term name. It can also be helpful in combination with `:plain` filter, like `{post_terms_xxxx:slug:plain}`, when using it inside conditions, taxonomy query, ... to compare the correct values (`@since 2.0`).

##### Examples of :array_value filter {#array_value-filter-examples}

`{acf_place_map:array_value|lat}` - Echoes the `$value['lat']` of the ACF google map type field

`{acf_place_map:array_value|post_code}` - Echoes the `$value['post_code']` of the ACF google map type field

`{acf_ext_link:array_value|title}` - Echoes the `$value['title']` of the ACF link type field

`{je_football-team_logo:array_value|id}` - Echoes the `$value['id']` of the JetEngine media field (Value format set as Array with media ID and URL)

`{mb_testimonials_user_image:array_value|name}` - Echoes the `$value['name']` of the Metabox single image field

`{echo:custom_function:array_value|hello}` - Echoes the `$value['hello']` of PHP `custom_function()` function

## Key-value pair arguments {#arguments}

This feature allows for greater flexibility and customization in displaying dynamic content. The general syntax for using key-value pair arguments is: `{dynamic_data_tag @key:value}`.

- Wrap text with spaces in single quotes.
- The value can include other dynamic data tags (e.g., `{acf_text_field @fallback:'No content was found for {post_title}'}`).

### Available arguments:

<span id="fallback"></span>

`@fallback` – Provides fallback text if the dynamic data tag doesn't return any data. This argument can be used with any dynamic data tag (`@since 1.10`).

- **Example:** `{acf_text_field @fallback:'This is the fallback text!'}`. If `acf_text_field` is empty, "This is the fallback text!" will be displayed.
- **Example**: `{acf_page_builder_cta_modul_options_css_id:raw @fallback:'{acf_get_row_layout:raw}-{query_loop_index:raw}'}`. If `acf_page_builder_cta_modul_options_css_id` is empty, use current ACF flexible layout concatenate with current loop index as return string. Good use case when using this on dynamic CSS ID.

<span id="fallback-image"></span>

`**@fallback-image**` – Used for image dynamic data tags. It accepts either an attachment ID or a URL.

- **Examples:** `{acf_image @fallback-image:554}` or `{acf_image @fallback-image:'https://example.com/placeholder.png'}`. If `acf_image` is not available, the specified image (by attachment ID or URL) will be displayed.

<span id="sanitize"></span>

`@sanitize` - Available `@since 1.11.1` it allows you to control the sanitization method applied to all dynamic tags within a "text" context. By default, all dynamic tags are sanitized using `wp_kses_post`, which helps secure output by stripping unwanted HTML and scripts.

This argument is particularly useful if you have a shortcode outputting JavaScript—such as a form shortcode from plugins—stored within a custom field. In earlier versions, this JavaScript would be sanitized, preventing the form from functioning when the field is output via `{acf_custom_field}`.

**Examples:**

- `{acf_my_wysiwyg @sanitize:false}` – Disables sanitization, allowing scripts to be output if stored in the custom field. **Use carefully, ensuring that the content is safe for output without sanitization.**
- `{acf_my_wysiwyg @sanitize:sanitize_email}` – Applies `sanitize_email` to the `my_wysiwyg` field. If the value doesn’t pass as a valid email, it returns empty.
- `{acf_my_wysiwyg @sanitize:sanitize_email @fallback:'abc@gmail.com'}` – Applies `sanitize_email` to the `my_wysiwyg` field. If the result is empty, it falls back to `'abc@gmail.com'`.

:::note
**Note:** The `@sanitize` argument only accepts methods listed in the [WordPress Sanitizing API](https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/security/sanitizing/) , `**false**` or `wp_kses`. If using `@sanitize:false`, be cautious, as this will output the field content without sanitization.
